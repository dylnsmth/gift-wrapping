# Gift-Wrapping

### Project Description
Let's wrap some gifts together!

### Contents
- this README
- graham.py
  - this is our implementation of the Graham Scan algorithm
  - its input is an unordered list of points on a 2D plane
  - its output is an ordered list of points that will form the convex hull
- jarvis.py
  - this is our implementation of the Jarvis March algorithm
  - its input is an unordered list of points on a 2D plane
  - its output is an ordered list of points that will form the convex hull
- test-cases.py
  - this file contains two lists of points that can be used to test our programs

### How to use
Run graham.py or jarvis.py. Enter a list of points when prompted (possibly by copying and pasting from test-cases.py)
